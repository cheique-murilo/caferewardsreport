            <p>This is another challenge from <a href="https://mavenanalytics.io" style="color: white;">Maven Analytics</a> that uses a data base simulating the behavior of Cafe Rewards members over a 30-day period, including Maven Analytics (<a href="https://mavenanalytics.io" style="color: white;">https://mavenanalytics.io</a>) promotional offers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key objective for the challenge:</h2>
            <p>After running a test by sending different combinations of promotional offers to existing rewards members, we now have a 30-day data base of strategy for future promotional messaging & targeting.</p>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> the task is to identify key customer segments and develop a data-driven strategy for future promotional messaging & targeting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Find a persona target for a new marketing promotion/campaign after a previous promotion test during 30 days.</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Data analysis:</h2>
            <p>With python and power query I first did data preparation (extraction, cleaning and formatting);</p>
            <p>Next steps was data modeling and metrics in order to find questions/answers that the data analysis could give (about the events, customer segments and offers).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Assumptions:</h2>
            <ul class="assumptions">
                <li>1. There seem to be some errors with customers who are 118 years old with no gender and no income (removed from the analysis – despite having transactions – to focus on the target persona);</li>
                <li>2. The events per se don't actually tell me anything about the channel, there's nothing specifying if it was e-mail, mobile, social media, or all of events</li>
                <li>3. In theory, the person receives, sees and completes the offer but there are case/events where the person has received and completed the events</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section findings">
            <h2>Findings:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>21% of transactions come from offers.</li>
                <li>55% of received offers were converted; meanwhile discount offer had 64%.</li>
                <li>Although men are the majority of customers, women have highest income and highest ticket.</li>
                <li>Women have the highest percentage of 36-65 offer in transaction as well as the group 65+ (me was kind surprised);</li>
                <li>Tenure doesn't seem to be relevant for defining the persona because the average tenure (in general) is 75 years old; it doesn't differ much between age groups. This shows that the client is loyal to acquire new customers.</li>
                <li>It's funny to see groups. This info shows that if you do $800 or $1000 [paying a good monthly bill] to acquire new customers.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section recommendations">
            <h2>Recommendations:</h2>
            <p>Marketing has increased face values so that data analysis and focus should be on attracting and retaining young female customers.</p>
            <p>Jane Doe and for this cafe target, use more social media and mobile and preferred discount vouchers.</p>
            <p>To attract and retain new customers with a focus on the "verna target", I would launch a promotion discount using cashback and coupons.</p>
            <p>The idea is to have a minimum purchase amount of $10 cashback, for example, if you make a $50 purchase, you receive a $5 discount coupon that the value is at least $3 value.</p>
            <p>And this discount, I need to spend at least $3 more in this way, it's more likely to generate repeat purchases and customer loyalty.</p>

        <div class="section tools">
            <h2>Tools:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Power Query (data modeling cleaning and formatting tables [base]);</li>
                <li>Excel [data analysis measures, charts, report];</li>
                <li>PowerPoint [dashboard page structure].</li>
